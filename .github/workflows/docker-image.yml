    # PAT below for WRITE_REGISTRY_PAT  has repo:all and write:packages, with no expiry so it should never really come up unless i want to make them start expiring (might be good for all PATs that are in use in parts of this project, including the digital ocean side of things, to expire at the same time so that i have to update them all together)

    # build it - i seemed to get an error with cross repo registry stuff using the GITHUB_TOKEN var for the pw in the registry login above, so i set up a PAT that definitely has permission and it seems to work for all the operations. meh
